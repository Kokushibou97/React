To install this package you'll need to use the following command in the terminal:
npm install react-player

Once you have this package installed, you can start using it in your project.

There are a few ways that you can import and use the installed package. For example, to get the entire package's functionality, use the following import:
import ReactPlayer from "react-player";

If you are, for example, only planning to use videos from a site like YouTube, to reduce bundle size, you can use the following import:
import ReactPlayer from "react-player/youtube";

Hereâ€™s an example of using the react-player packaged in a small React app:
import React from "react";
import ReactPlayer from "react-player/youtube";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyVideo />
    </div>
  );
};

const MyVideo = () => {
  return (
    <ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysz5S6PUM-U' />
  );
};

export default App;
