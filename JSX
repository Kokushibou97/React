What is it that makes JSX so special? In one word, expressiveness. 
Developers can express what they want to react to render using a very expressive syntax, almost identical to HTML or XML. 
In other words, JSX allows developers to write HTML directly inside the JavaScript code. For example, you can add navigation function to a website by creating a nav component. 
Then place the HTML semantic nav element, and an unordered list inside. Because this is React, the list values can be made dynamic by passing values as props. 
Is important to note that a regular JavaScript function is used to define how React should render the component wherever it's referenced using the nav JSX elements. 
This is what makes JSX so powerful, like the fact that you can insert specific JSX expressions such as variables and props. 
The reason why this is so great to work with, is because anything that's placed inside the curly braces of the code is essentially regular JavaScript code.
