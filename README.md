# React

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
Components are one of the foundations of React. In React, everything revolves around components.


Simple components combined into more complex ones, which eventually merge to form a website. A website can essentially be viewed as a highly complex components. Components and website UIs are not to limited to React. 

There's a part of the reason why React is so popular, is because it streamlines the process of building and composing components. React does this efficiently and without a significant impact on your browser's resources. Another major topic that will be discussed in this course is working with state in React apps. 



According to the concept of the single-page application or SPA for short; This is a one-page website where some of the pages content changes based on user interaction. SPA differ from traditional website, where each web page needs to be loaded as the user navigates around the site. 
This frequent reload can be considered inefficient as some of the same content such as logos, navigation, and footers need to be loaded again. And one of the most popular ways to build an SPA is with the React library from Meta. 

React used to run many of the world's most popular websites. Often on these sites, you're type a search term into the sites input box. The site then returns the relevant content or results. Even though the content has updated, the sites URL doesn't change. As SPA only load the content as required, they can be ideal for businesses and enterprises who need a web app that offers rich user interfaces, speed scalability, and flexibility. 

When meta released the React library, it included the concept of something called component-based architecture. This is essentially a design philosophy for building software based on reusable components of code. Each component consists of well-defined functionality that can be inserted into an application without requiring modification of other components. 

Because components are reusable, they can be used multiple times and easily inserted anywhere we're needed. This results in components that can exist within the same space yet interact independently from each other. One of the advantages of developing using components is that many developers can work on the same project without interfering with the code of other developers' components. As you may recall, modern front-end web development revolves around the concept of creating standalone parts of the user interface, or UI for short. Well, in react, these standalone parts are created using components which form the foundation of all UI design. It's important to know that all UI is composed of simple components that can be combined into more complex components. In fact, you can think of an entire website is just a collection of components.
