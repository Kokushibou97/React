# React

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
Components are one of the foundations of React. In React, everything revolves around components.


Simple components combined into more complex ones, which eventually merge to form a website. A website can essentially be viewed as a highly complex components. Components and website UIs are not to limited to React. 
There's a part of the reason why React is so popular, is because it streamlines the process of building and composing components. React does this efficiently and without a significant impact on your browser's resources. Another major topic that will be discussed in this course is working with state in React apps.
